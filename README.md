# Introduction to PyTorch
One of the most important concepts in machine learning, is deep learning. Deep learning is advanced form of the learning. It can be used to classify large amount of data. Simple models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and ... . are not so powerful in these cases. We need another models in which it can handles big data to predict some classes. These models called Neural Network (NN) or Deep Learning. Behind the scene, is several linear and non-linear models.   
Each linear model is assigned to a **Dense Layer**, and each non-linear model called **Activator** and is assigned to **Hidden Layer**. There are three well-known activator  
- Rectified Linear Activation **(ReLU)**
- Logistic **(Sigmoid)**
- Hyperbolic Tangent **(Tanh)**
